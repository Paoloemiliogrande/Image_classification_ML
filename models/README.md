# Model Weights - Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the model weights folder for our machine learning project. This directory contains links to the model weights that we have utilized throughout our research and development process. Given the substantial size of the model weights, we have provided download links to Google Drive for the download of the weights.

Below, you will find details about each set of model weights and where they have been used within the project.


## Links to download model weights from google Drive
  - [Google Drive - Transfer Learning with VGG16](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TLk1a3S4BelJHTZURX0e3CZvVAt8yeAv/view?usp=share_link): This model has been fine-tuned on 5 output classes.
  - [Google Drive - CNN_team5.h5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vc1Nr3eRSrDtQkVr5daG1xL49M9ODmfc/view?usp=share_link): This model has 4 output classes.
